Source & A single detection of an astrophysical object in an image, the characteristics for which are stored in the Source Catalog of the DRP database. The association of Sources that are non-moving lead to Objects; the association of moving Sources leads to Solar System Objects. (Note that in non-LSST usage "source" is often used for what LSST calls an Object.) \\\hline

TS & Test Specification \\\hline
XML & eXtensible Markup Language \\\hline
configuration & A task-specific set of configuration parameters, also called a 'config'. The config is read-only; once a task is constructed, the same configuration will be used to process all data. This makes the data processing more predictable: it does not depend on the order in which items of data are processed. This is distinct from arguments or options, which are allowed to vary from one task invocation to the next. \\\hline
